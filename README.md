# Penetration-Test-Report

## Description
For this project, I go through a fake company's back end databases and web application to simulate the role of a penetration tester. The project was conducted as a capture the flag event within my Cybersecurity Bootcamp at UNCC School of Professional Studies. <br><br>
(For transparency, the report itself is a template given to me through the Cybersecurity Bootcamp provided by UNCC School of Professional Studies. The only parts I am personally responsible for are highlighted in the report.)
